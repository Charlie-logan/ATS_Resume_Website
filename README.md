## Getting Started

Follow these instructions to get a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

*   A modern web browser.
*   (Optional) A local web server if you prefer to serve files that way.

### Installation & Running

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repository-name.git
    ```
2.  **Navigate to the project directory:**
    ```bash
    cd your-repository-name
    ```
3.  **Open `index.html` in your browser:**
    You can directly open the `index.html` file in your web browser to view the application.
    Alternatively, you can use a simple HTTP server (e.g., `npx serve` or Python's `http.server`) to serve the project directory.

    *Example using `npx serve` (Node.js required):*
    ```bash
    npx serve .
    ```
    Then open your browser to the local address provided (e.g., `http://localhost:3000`).


## Customizing Resume Content

All resume data is centrally managed in the `src/resumeData.ts` file. To personalize the resume:

1.  **Locate the data file:** Open `src/resumeData.ts`.
2.  **Modify the `resumeData` object:** Update the object with your personal details, experience, projects, etc. The structure of this object is defined by TypeScript interfaces in `src/types.ts`.
3.  **Save the file:** Your changes will be reflected when you refresh the `index.html` page in your browser.

### Data Structure

The data structure is defined in `src/types.ts`. Refer to this file to understand the expected format for each section (e.g., `ContactInfo`, `WorkExperience`, `Project`, `EducationEntry`).

## Directory Structure
